    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Ali Al-Hashemi, and I'm a Wayne State University graduate,
      class of 2020. I studied biochemistry and chemical biology, and have a
      passion for life systems and all of their associated pathways. I have
      multiple hobbies, which include but are not limited to: lifting, boxing,
      mountain biking, playing videogames, and watching TV shows and anime. I
      spend a great deal of my time connecting with others and learning other
      languages and cultures!
