    <p>
      Some of my GC classmates and I developed a working log-in system for users
      to interact with gym memberships. They have the option to check into a
      gym, join a new gym, or leave a gym and cancel their membership. The
      project was done entirely within C# .NET and is a console application.

    </h2>
    <p>
      This program allows users to access a database of listed countries. They
      have the option to choose a country, and receive information such as the
      continent in which it is located. It also allows for users to see the
      country's flag colors.
